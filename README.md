# Tokyo-Airbnb-Dashboard
This Tableau dashboard analyzes real 2022 Airbnb data for Tokyo (sourced from Kaggle’s Inside Airbnb project). It examines listing distribution, pricing, and revenue trends to help potential hosts understand market distribution and pricing strategies, enabling them to make informed business decisions.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze Tokyo’s Airbnb market using real data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsarromanov/tokyo-airbnb-open-data?select=listings.csv">Kaggle</a>.
- Help potential hosts decide where to open new listings.
- Guide hosts on how to price their properties competitively.
- Identify which types of properties or room types to offer.
- Understand overall supply, demand, and guest preferences.

## Initial Questions
- Which Tokyo neighborhoods have the highest concentration of listings?
- Where are the most expensive and most affordable areas to operate?
- What room types are most common, and what do they typically cost?
- How does total market revenue fluctuate over time?
- Which areas might offer the best opportunities for new hosts?

## My Process
- Looked for real market data related to Airbnb.
- Connected the data to Tableau, joined two sheets (listings summary and calendar), and explored key fields such as neighborhood, room type, price, and availability.
- Designed interactive visualizations to clearly answer each initial question.
- Interpreted patterns and insights to provide actionable recommendations for potential hosts.
